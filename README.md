# groundMotionsDatabase_CEUS
It contains a database of ground motion recordings for earthquakes in Central and Eastern United States. Spectral accelerations are calculated for RotD50 component of horizontal time histories for all events with magnitudes ≥ 3 and epicentral distance ≤ 200 km from Jan 01, 2001 to Dec 31, 2016 for the CEUS region between 27° and 55° latitudes and -105° and -70° longitudes.
For details on data processing, refer to : Gupta, Baker, Ellsworth, Assessing ground motion amplitudes and attenuation for small to moderate induced and tectonic earthquakes in the Central and Eastern United States, 2017.
